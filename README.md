# Map Coloring Visualization

This project is a map coloring visualization that allows users to select a country, choose a maximum number of colors, and an algorithm to apply to the map. The visualization uses D3.js and TopoJSON to display the selected map, and CSP algorithms to apply the selected algorithm to the map.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have a modern web browser installed.

### Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are required to use this project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pal0064/constraint-satisfaction-ai.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Usage

To use the map coloring visualization:

1. Select a country from the drop-down menu
2. Enter a maximum number of colors between 3 and 5
3. Select an algorithm from the drop-down menu
4. Click the "Run CSP" button to apply the selected algorithm to the map

The visualization will display the selected map, and apply the selected algorithm to color the map with the selected maximum number of colors.
